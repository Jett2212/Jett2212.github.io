This project was for the Global Game Jam 2025.
The theme was "Bubbles". As a team we decided to make an underwater survival game.
The gameplay loop was to go outside of your safe bubble to collect resources and food.
Resources could then be used to upgrade the oxygen tank, bubble size and the shelter size.
I was involved in the map/ level design, the water movement and water/ bubble postprocessing, and the upgrading systems.
