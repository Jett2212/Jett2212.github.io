As part of a university module, I was asked to work in a group to make an engaging game.
As a group we decided to make a space puzzle game.

I was involved in making a system allowing the user to flip and change their gravity.
I also made a pressure plate interaction system and designed the final level.

As part of the team, I had the role of lead programmer. 
This involved me being in charge of source control. Advising and helping on many of the systems created. 
And assisting with any technical problems or issues that arose.
