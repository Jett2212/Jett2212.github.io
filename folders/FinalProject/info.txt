This is what I am doing for my final project. 
It is still a work in progress.
My idea is an artificial intelligence / machine learning based mesh generation system.
At the time of writing this, I have a semi successful version.
I have made a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) as it seemed the easiest one to start with.
I first created it working solely with the CPU and working in Unreal. 
Once created and tested, I then implemented it using CUDA to run on the graphics card to speed it up.

Future work on this may involve creating a graph neural network (GNN) or a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
