For this tool, I wanted to be able to place actors in an area randomly.
I wanted to be able to seed the randomisation. 
After using the Unreal seeded randomiser, I decided to try making my own
as the unreal one did not work as I wanted it to, often by creating a pattern in the placement.

I first adapted the method used by unreal, by changing some numbers and adding some additional behaviour.
I also tried a method of "simulating" a line bouncing within a box and using the first method to generate points on the line.
Another method I experimented with was using a chaos machine to generate numbers.

Using these methods, I made a tool to visualise a box, and where the actors would be placed.
The tool interface has options to choose which randomisation method to use, actor count, seed and minimum distance between actors.

As part of this project, I also started to look into perlin noise for landscape / mesh generation. And into other uses for procedural meshes such as creating shapes along a spline.
